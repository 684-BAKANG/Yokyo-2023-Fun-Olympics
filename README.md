# 2023-Yokyo-Fun-Olympics
To install and deploy the prototype of the dashboard system in a production environment, please follow the procedures outlined below.

## 1.0 System Requirements

Ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

•	Operating System: The production environment should support the operating system compatible with both Python and Power BI Desktop e.g., Windows, macOS, or Linux).

•	Python: The production environment must have a compatible version of Python (preferably Python 3.x) installed. Ensure that all necessary Python libraries, such as pandas and matplotlib, are also installed. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

•	Power BI Desktop: Install the compatible version of Power BI Desktop in the production environment. Power BI Desktop is responsible for creating and editing the dashboard. You can download Power BI Desktop from the Microsoft Power BI website at https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/.


•	Data Source: The data required for the dashboard should be accessible and available in a format compatible with Python and Power BI (e.g., CSV, Excel, or a supported database).

•	Hardware: The production environment should meet the hardware requirements for both Python and Power BI, including sufficient disk space, memory, and processing power to handle the data and visualization demands.

## 2.0 Installation and Deployment Procedures
Follow these procedures to install and deploy the prototype of the dashboard using Python Jupyter Framework in the production environment:

## 1.0 Clone or Download the Repository
Clone the repository containing the dashboard code and assets using Git, or download it as a ZIP file and extract the contents to a suitable location in the production environment.

## 2.0 Set up the Environment
Ensure that Python is installed in the production environment, preferably the same version used during development.
Install the necessary Python libraries required for the dashboard, such as pandas and matplotlib. Use the package manager, pip, to install the dependencies.

## 3.0 Prepare the Data
Ensure that the data required for the dashboard is available in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, Excel, or a supported database).
Place the data file(s) in a location accessible to the Jupyter notebooks.

## 4.0 Data Processing and Analysis
Open the Jupyter notebook file(s) provided in the repository using a Jupyter-compatible environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab).
Customize the code in the notebooks as per your specific data preprocessing and analysis requirements.
Update the file paths in the code to point to the location of the data file(s).

## 5.0 Run the Dashboard Notebooks
Execute the code in the Jupyter notebooks to generate the visualizations and results for the dashboard.
Ensure that the notebook cells run successfully and produce the expected output.

## 6.0 Monitor and Maintain
Regularly monitor the performance and stability of the dashboard in the production environment.
Update the dashboard as needed, incorporating new data or modifying the code and visualizations.
